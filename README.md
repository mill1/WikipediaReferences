Console utility regarding citations of humans in Wikipedia list articles.

### Personal utility
I created this console application to assists me in my endeavour to improve the quality of the [Deaths per month articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_deaths_by_year) on Wikipedia.
For some time now Wikipedia requires citing a source when listing someone in an article but many are still missing. This tool is able to easily and automatically generate these citations (references) from various sources.

### The New York Times Archive API
Another useful feature is the use of [archive API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/archive-product/1/overview) of [The New York times](https://www.nytimes.com/). 
By accessing their data all deceased in a Deaths per month article can be cross-referenced with the obituary data of the archive. A text file is generated containing the added and updated NYTimes citations. 
Since it is in [wikitext format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext) its contents can be pasted directly into the list article.
